This directory contains examples of some of MOAB's key functionality.
Each example described here corresponds to a source file.  To make all
examples, enter 'make check'.  To make a specific example, list that
example name on the make command line.  For example,

  make FileRead

will make the FileRead example, while

  make check

will make all the examples.

The GetEntities example is located in the "simple" subdirectory.  The
makefile there indicates how to build a program linked to MOAB using a
simple makefile.

The Makefile.am in the main examples directory illustrates how to
build a program linked to MOAB using a GNU autotools build system.

For more information on these examples, refer to the MOAB Code
Examples webpage at

Simple Examples
===============
    simple/GetEntities: get the number of entities of each dimension

    SetsNTags: query the sets in a mesh and tags on those sets


General Mesh Query & Manipulation
=================================
    SkinMesh: compute the outer faces of a mesh

    SurfArea: compute the surface area of the skin of a mesh

    ObbTree: construct an obb tree from input triangles and do ray-tracing

    KDTree: construct a kD-tree from a hexahedral mesh and then search
            for some points


Mesh Import
