How to generate doxygen document for MOAB in Linux:

-  Install doxygen, and include the doxygen installation path to PATH.

-  After checking out moab from bitbucket, do following under moab directory:

   autoreconf -fi
   ./configure [options] --enable-docs --with-doxygen=DIR
   make
   make check
   cd doc
   doxygen user.dox

(--ebable-docs indicates to check for doxygen installation under your given --with-doxygen directory or, if --with-doxygen is not given, under your PATH. If doxygen execuable is not found, it'll report error and exit configure.

If you are sure doxygen is installed and put into PATH, you don't need to add --enable-docs or --with-doxygen, going to doc directory and directly applying "doxygen user.dox" should generate all the documents.)

-  After doxygen is done, you should be able to open web browser, and view MOAB document at file://your_moab_dir/doc/html/index.html .
