Name: MOAB
Description: The Mesh-Oriented datABase, or MOAB, is a library 
  for representing unstructured and structured mesh, and field 
  data on a mesh. MOAB represents the finite element zoo, 
  plus polygons and polyhedra. MOABâ€™s data model is simple 
  yet powerful, being able to represent most kinds of 
  metadata often accompanying the mesh (e.g. boundary 
  conditions, processor partitions, geometric topology).
