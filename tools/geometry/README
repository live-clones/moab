These are tools related to the representation of geometry and geometric
topology in MOAB.

Most of these depend on the existence of a functioning CGM installation, and
some may recquire a version of CGM based on ACIS.

cgm2moab: This tool was originally written to perform operations related to
          the conversion of a geometry represented in a file format recognized
          by CGM into a MOAB representation.  The most common options are for
          setting tolerances used in faceting the geometry (these may be added
          to mbconvert in the future).  Other options include the ability to
          impose alternate faceting/tesselation on individual surfaces, and
          the ability to generate a visualization of the oriented bounding box
          tree that is generated for geometric queries.
