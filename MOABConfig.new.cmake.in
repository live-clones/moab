# MOAB_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories from which to pick up MOAB includes
# MOAB_LIBRARIES    - libraries need to link to MOAB; use this in target_link_libraries for MOAB-dependent targets
# MOAB_CXX, MOAB_CC, MOAB_F77, MOAB_FC - compilers used to compile MOAB
# MOAB_CXXFLAGS, MOAB_CCFLAGS, MOAB_FFLAGS, MOAB_FCFLAGS - compiler flags used to compile MOAB; possibly need to use these in add_definitions or CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<MODE>
